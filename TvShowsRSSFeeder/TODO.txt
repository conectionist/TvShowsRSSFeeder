- add tabs in settings window (basically organize settings by categories)
- save settings in file
- add categories (Revenge, Game of Thrones, Simpsons etc.) dynamically to a tab in the settings window and next to them, 
  a textbox with the path where to save the episodes from the respective tv series on the disk 
  (e.g. Revenge: D:\Videos\Seriale\Revenge\Season 4)
  This can be done by parsing name from received rss feeds
- save them and add new ones if they appear; else get them from config file
- message box if there is not path set before downloading
- add newly downloaded torrents to utorrent directly (it just opens utorrent as if double clicking on the torrent)
- check if utorrent is running first and if not, start it
- add elements from download dialog on a (scrollable) panel (in case there are a lot of)
- disable download button after being clicked
- add downloaded torrents to another "config" file and use it to filter "new" torrents before adding them to download dialog
  basically allow to dismiss torrents I don't want to download or ones I have already downloaded
- add tab in settings when u can specify a torrent client and the syntax for opening a torrent file from the command line (and maybe other operations in the future)
